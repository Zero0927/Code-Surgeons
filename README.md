Discussion summary: 

We discussed the team name, meeting dates, choosing a repository, and general planning on the deliverable. For the team name, we came up with Crazy Code Surgeons (CCS). We agreed to meet after class on Tuesday for 15 minutes for progress-checking and after class on Thursday. We chose GitHub as a place to store future documents. As such, each of us will watch videos on how to use GitHub effectively. Also, for the deliverable, we will research about user stories and write at least 5 user stories from the given client interview. In addition, we discussed about commitment issues and reached some agreements: for individual who exercise too much control over the project, we will gently talk to the person about the importance of letting other people share their ideas; if someone appears to be shouldering their responsibilities, we will remind them about the work to be done; and if weather affects transportation, we will use Skype to communicate at the time scheduled as meeting time.
